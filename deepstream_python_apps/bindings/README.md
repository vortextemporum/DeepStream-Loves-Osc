# Python Bindings

The DeepStream Python bindings are currently released in a compiled module.  
Please see the [HOW-TO Guide](../HOWTO.md) and [FAQ](../FAQ.md) for usage information. More detailed documentation will be added as the API matures.  

Portions of these bindings are generated using [Pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) under these [licensing terms](LICENSE.pybind11).
